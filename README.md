The main motive:
	Children nowadays go through a lot of stuff and may not discuss it with anyone's land then make bad decisions. We want the children to learn some important life lessons through an exciting game!!

How to play:
	The child has to make a choice between two options and select the appropriate one. The child then has to shoot at two monsters available and will get a plus score on shooting at the right target and a negative score otherwise.
	This way, they can get to know what the right choice can be!

How to run:
	Run the "main.py" file by the command "python run.py."
